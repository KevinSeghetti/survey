quiz site I use as a sample code base with real world requirements I use to learn new technologies

This is a small app I use to learn new technologies. 

It is a NSFW site I did for a local community. 
Since some potential employers have asked to see code samples, I have made a SFW version as well. 
(so if it seems silly, it made more sense in its original context). 
The basic idea is: someone answers a lot of questions, then shares them with others to review.
Both versions of the app are in this code base, if you poke around enough in the history you will find some NSFW references. 

Since it is a technology test bed, it has several different frameworks and libraries pulled into it.
