example enviroment when using locally installed packages:
setenv PYTHONPATH "/home/kts/kts/localpythonlibraries/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/:/home/kts/kts/localpythonlibraries/lib/python3.5/site-packages/"

when using pipsetup.sh, need to pass in location of local libraries. To match the above, use
/home/kts/kts/localpythonlibraries/
note this has to be set *before* running pipsetup, since it installs and then tries to use pyaml
