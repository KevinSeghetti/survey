        This is an interactive version of a checklist I found
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128121457/http://www.cepemo.com/checklist.html">
        here</a>


Checklists are frequently difficult to complete due to the complex variety to what we enjoy.
When we try to fill them out as Tops, Bottoms, Dominants, Submissives, etcetera there is usually 
confusion over fetishes that aren't physically interactive between partners or over activities 
that may not clear as to who is giving and who receiving. A sincere effort has been made here 
to reduce this kind of confusion, but bdsm checklists will <i>never</i> be perfect enough that 
you won't probably have to go to your partner and confer about how to answer at least one item. 
Take it as a blessing in disguise - a bdsm checklist is only supposed to get a conversation 
started. That's what the tool is made for. Remember, it's just a beginning to negotiation, not 
an end in itself.
<br><br>
<b>Done to/for Self:</b> Read this as how you feel about being on the receiving end of the act.<br>
(As examples, here Whipping would refer to you being whipped, while Massage would mean you're the one on the table.)
<br><br>
<b>Done to/for Others:</b> Read this as how you feel about having someone else receive this act.<br>
(In the examples above, you would be delivering the Whipping, or serving your partner a Massage.)
<br><br>
<b>Tried:</b> Have you tried this? 
<br><br>
<b>Rating:</b> How does/might this feel to you? Use the chart below as a guide.
