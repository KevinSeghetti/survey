        Welcome to the online BDSM checklist. This is an interactive version of a checklist I found
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128121457/http://www.cepemo.com/checklist.html">
        here</a>. <br />
        I love this checklist, but found using it on paper cumbersome. For example, once filled
        out, I wanted a quick way to view all items marked 'love'.<br />
        All of the questions and instructions are blatently taken from there (I have begun looking for the
        original author, if anyone knows who that is drop me an email through the link at the bottom of this page).
        <br />
        Instructions can be found <a href="/static/checklist/instructions.html">
        here
        </a>

          To publish your results, copy the following link:
          <a href="{{ publish_url }}">
                   {{ publish_url }}
          </a>
       {% endif %}
    </div>
