        Welcome to the online sports checklist. It can be used to help people
        interested in various sports match up with others of similar interest.

        You will need to create an account to see most of the site.
        <br /><br />
        A potential client recently asked me if I had a deployed site they could
        look at. Most of my recent work for hire projects are either not open
        the public, or are not yet deployed.
        So I deployed this so they would have something to look at.
        <br /><br />

        This is a small app I use to learn new technologies. It is a SFW version
        of a NSFW site I did for a local community. (so if it seems silly, it
        made more sense it its original context). The basic idea is: someone
        answers a lot of questions, then shares them with others to review.
        <br /><br />

        This app is implemented using Django. It began will all pages using django forms.
        Since then I have used it to experiment with a few technologies.
        <br />
        So the
        <a href="/checklist/questions/edit/">question editor</a> uses backbone.js. <br />
        The
        <a href="/checklist/edit/">answer editor</a> uses ReactJS. <br />

        both of those are communicating with the back end via a REST interface.

        Welcome to the online BDSM checklist. This is an interactive version of a checklist I found
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128121457/http://www.cepemo.com/checklist.html">
        here</a>. <br />
        I love this checklist, but found using it on paper cumbersome. For example, once filled
        out, I wanted a quick way to view all items marked 'love'.<br />
        All of the questions and instructions are blatently taken from there (I have been looking for the
        original author, if anyone knows who that is drop me an email through the link at the bottom of this page).

       {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
          <br />To publish your results for anyone to be able to view, copy the following link:
          <a href="{{ publish_url }}">
                   {{ publish_url_text }}
          </a>
        <br />
            <p>To use: The first step is to click the Fill out checklist button, and start answering questions.
            You do not have to answer all of the questions in a single sitting, but you do need to
            scroll to the bottom of the page and click submit to save what answered you have filled out.
            </p>
            <p>
            After saving a partially filled out checklist, you may resume by clicing "Resume checklist"
            to view only the questioms you have not answered yet.
            </p>
            <p>

            You may return at any time and edit your answers by clicking 'Fill out checklist' again.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once you have finished the questionaire, the "View Results" page can be used to display/print/download
            your answers. This page can also filter for certain results, as well as sort the results.
            </p>
